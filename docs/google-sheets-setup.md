## üîß Testing the Integration

### 1. Restart n8n Services
```bash
docker compose restart n8n
```

### 2. Import Updated Workflow
1. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Import the updated `workflows/reddit-monitoring-google-ai.json`
3. Activate the workflow

### 3. Manual Test
1. In n8n, click "Execute Workflow" on the Schedule Trigger
2. Monitor the execution
3. Check your Google Sheet for new data

### 4. Verify Automatic Operation
- The workflow runs every 15 minutes
- Check the Google Sheet periodically for new entries
- All analyzed Reddit posts will appear in the sheet

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient permissions" error:**
- Ensure the service account email has Editor access to the spreadsheet
- Double-check the spreadsheet is shared correctly

**"Invalid credentials" error:**
- Verify the private key is properly formatted in the .env file
- Ensure the client_email matches exactly

**"Spreadsheet not found" error:**
- Check the SPREADSHEET_ID is correct
- Ensure the spreadsheet exists and is accessible

**"Sheet not found" error:**
- The workflow will create the sheet automatically
- Ensure GOOGLE_SHEETS_SHEET_NAME matches your desired sheet name

### Debug Steps
1. Check n8n execution logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test credentials manually using Google Sheets API explorer
4. Ensure the spreadsheet URL is accessible

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Keep credentials secure**: Never commit the private key to version control
2. **Use service accounts**: Don't use personal Google accounts for automation
3. **Limit permissions**: Only grant necessary access to the spreadsheet
4. **Regular rotation**: Consider rotating service account keys periodically
5. **Monitor usage**: Check Google Cloud Console for API usage and billing

## üìà Data Analysis

Once data starts flowing to Google Sheets, you can:

1. **Create pivot tables** to analyze trends by subreddit, sentiment, or intent
2. **Build charts** to visualize relevance scores over time
3. **Filter and sort** to focus on high-priority opportunities
4. **Export data** for external analysis tools
5. **Share insights** with team members who have spreadsheet access

## üîÑ Integration Benefits

**Dual Storage Strategy:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Structured data for applications and complex queries
- **Google Sheets**: Easy access, sharing, and business user analysis

**Business Value:**
- Immediate visibility into opportunities
- Easy data sharing with non-technical team members
- Built-in Google Workspace integration
- Simple filtering and sorting capabilities
- Real-time collaboration features
